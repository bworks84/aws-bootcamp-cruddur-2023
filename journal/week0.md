# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Setup
  - This week I set up a new root account in AWS, created an organization for the AWS Bootcamp and created an Admin user that will be the user I primarily use for creating other roles, permissions, etc. I set up MFA for both. 
  - I set up a AWS Budget for the bootcamp, along with billing alerts, and will set up CloudWatch once I begin to utilize AWS services for this program. 
  - I forked over the AWS Bootcamp repo
  - Registered on Discord
  - Registered a domain name - thecloudytech.net
  - Set up a gitpod account and integrated the workspace with GitHub repo. Also set up AWS CLI with the gitpod workspace and created my AWC CLI environment variables. 
  - I watched videos on AWS Spend Considerations, Security Considerations, and reviewed how to set up credentials via the CLI. 
  - I build a conceptual and logical diagram of the AWS Bootcamp app we will be creating the next several months. (Submitted in img folder)
  - Created a honeycomb.io account, set up codespaces in Github, and set up MFA on github account.
