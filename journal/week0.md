# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Setup
  - This week I set up a new root account in AWS, created an organization for the AWS Bootcamp and created an Admin user that will be the user I primarily use for creating other roles, permissions, etc. I set up MFA for both. 
  - I set up a AWS Budget for the bootcamp, along with billing alerts, and set up CloudWatch alarms. 
  - I forked over the AWS Bootcamp repo to my github account. 
  - Registered on Discord, networked with about 25 people on LinkedIn from the discord intro's
  - Registered a domain name - thecloudytech.net
  - Set up a gitpod account and integrated the workspace with GitHub repo (installed the browser extension). Also set up AWS CLI with the gitpod workspace and created my AWC CLI environment variables. 
    ** Had some difficulties with an SSH integration with VSCode and Gitpod.  But was able to figure it out and added a passphrase for SSH connection
  - I watched videos on AWS Spend Considerations, Security Considerations, and reviewed how to set up credentials via the CLI. 
  - I build a conceptual and logical diagram of the AWS Bootcamp app we will be creating the next several months. (Submitted in img folder)
  - Created a honeycomb.io account, set up codespaces in Github, and set up MFA on github account. 

  ### Follow-up 2/24
  - Returned to create an EventBridge notification via SNS to email me about CloudWatch spending based on spending consideration video. Confirmed via email. 
  - Returned to request an increase to service quota on EventBridge endpoints.  Researched different services and their service quotas, learned how to submit a request ticket

 #### Things to work on:
  - Source control
