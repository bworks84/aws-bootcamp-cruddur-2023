# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

##Steps

- This week I created a new GitHub repo, well forked actually from the main AWS Bootcamp repo
- Launched the repo in Gitpod where I used VSCode in the browser
- Cloned the frontend and backend of the project this week to work on building containers for each
- I installed Docker and learned how to build & remove a docker container
- Created Dockerfiles for each application (frontend & backend) and ensured both were running locally
- Created a docker-compose file to be able to build and run multiple containers at once
- Ensured CORS were set up properly...after a bit of troubleshooting.
