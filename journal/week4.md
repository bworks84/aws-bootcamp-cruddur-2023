- 3.20 - Fixed bugs!  Updated Activity Form component on pages/HomeFeedPage.js in frontend to pass the user_handle prop, updated the fetch request body to include the user_handle in components/ActivityForm.js, and assigned the user_handle variable following the other variables format in app.py api/activities route. All working now and posts are displaying correctly when signed in as user!!!  
    - These changes ensured the the user_handle prop is passed correctly and included in the fetch request.  The server can now retrieve it from the request payload!
